    "**Sugesstion:**\n",
    "1. if we use the following code in refresh() function, it will be more clear. \n",
    "    ```ruby\n",
    "    for imaginary in [self.ymax - self.ytick*i for i in range(self.ylen)]:\n",
    "\t\t\tself.plane.append([(real+1j*imaginary) for real in [self.xmin + self.xtick*i for i in range(self.xlen)]])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _\\_init\\_\\_() function will be called automatically, and only once when define the function. So we'd better not call it in function zoom() and set_f().\n",
    "3. It's not good to call function set_f() in zoom(), call refresh() in set_f(). Because it would be better for each function just implement on thing. \n"
